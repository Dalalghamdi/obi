	adapter-sequence trimming			A data transformation in which adapter sequences at the end of a molecular sequence are cut (removed).	Dan Berrios			Dan Berrios	subclass	http://edamontology.org/operation_3192	adapter-trimmed sequence data	(sequence data and adapter sequence data)			
	file merge			A data transformation in which data contained in 2 or more files are merged into a single file.	Dan Berrios			Dan Berrios	subclass	data transformation					
	sequence alignment			"A data transformation in which one or more sequences (reads) are positioned on a reference sequence template (often a reference set of genes), according to the genetic base-pairing paradigm."	Dan Berrios			Dan Berrios	subclass	sequence analysis data transformation	aligned sequence data	sequence data			
	sequence data feature count tabulation			"The counting of features (typically, genes) within aligned sequence data, and organization of these counts into one or more tables."

	trimmed sequence data			"The results of a data transformation of sequence data in which (e.g., low quality) read bases are removed, to achieve some specific objective."	Dan Berrios			Dan Berrios	equivalent	sequence data				http://edamontology.org/operation_3192	
	adapter sequence data			Nucleotide sequences of molecules that are ligated to assay samples prior to sequencing of these samples;  these sequences are provided by assay kit manufacturers and typically used to combine sequencing of multiple samples in one assay run.
