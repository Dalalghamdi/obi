The microelectrodes are filled with conductive solution and inserted into the cell to artificially control membrane potential. The membrane acts as a dielectric as well as a resistor, while the fluids on either side of the membrane function as capacitors.[9] The microelectrodes compare the membrane potential against a command voltage, giving an accurate reproduction of the currents flowing across the membrane. Current readings can be used to analyze the electrical response of the cell to different applications.

In this way, it was possible to combine the most popular transient expression system, and the associated benefits of molecular cloning and site-directed mutagenesis, with the superior voltage-clamp properties of cut-open cell techniques."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9711615			Gully Burns	subclass	voltage clamp assay					voltage clamp device						
OBI:0002185	current clamp assay			"The current clamp technique records the membrane potential by injecting current into a cell through the recording electrode. Unlike in the voltage clamp mode, where the membrane potential is held at a level determined by the experimenter, in ""current clamp"" mode the membrane potential is free to vary, and the amplifier records whatever voltage the cell generates on its own or as a result of stimulation. This technique is used to study how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell; this is important for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters that act by opening membrane ion channels."	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#Current_clamp			Gully Burns	subclass	intra cellular electrophysiology recording
